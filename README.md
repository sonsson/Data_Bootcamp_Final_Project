Clearly acknowledged the work and efforts of others when submitting written work as our own. The incorporation of the work of others–including but not limited to their ideas, data, creative expression, and direct quotations (which should be designated with quotation marks), or para- phrasing thereof– has been fully and appropriately referenced using notations both in the text and the bibliography.

In my project, I seek to find out the "consensus" peak year of performance in the NBA. Since different sports have different physical requirements, the peak age is presumably varying in sports. What is it in the NBA and how have league-wide shocks affected it? I utlize player statistics from 1952-2016 and analyze different splits to find any trends or stories of the NBA.
